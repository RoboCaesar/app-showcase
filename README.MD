1. DESCRIPTION

Welcome! This server app is designed to showcase a few apps I've made already. To accomplish this, I'm using Node.js, Webpack, Express, and more.

2. HOW TO RUN THIS

After cloning this on your machine, simply type 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install the dependencies. Then, check the package.json file to see which start script suits your needs (probably npm run start).
